                <h5><br>In 2008, I moved to Texas and wanted to find a fitness program that would teach me how to defend myself. Iâ€™ve always been physically active, but I wanted to challenge myself both mentally and physically. I came across an article about Krav Maga and thought it was perfect for me, today's independent, busy woman. Having no prior martial arts or self-defense experience, this was completely new to me. I took my first class in July of 2008 and instantly fell in love with the philosophy, simplicity, and practicality of Krav Maga. I was addicted! I wanted to teach others how to defend themselves, and I wanted to empower women by preparing them for whatever might come their way. After a lot of hard work and dedication, I received my 1st certification in 2012 and 2nd in 2013. As a Level 2 Krav Maga Instructor and Level 4 student, I am privileged to help others achieve their goals, especially women who come to class with all sorts of preconceived notions about themselves or about fighting. Seeing them take on new challenges, growing confidence and dedication, is continually rewarding. It is my mission to increase mental and physical strength within our female students, ensuring that they leave class with the ability to combat potential danger.</h5>

                <h5><br>After training for 2 years in Taikwondo and 4 years in Yoshukai Karate, I moved to Austin in 2005 and began training as a Krav Maga student.
I loved the simplicity, effectiveness, and training methodology of the system.  Simple skills based on instinctive movements practiced in stressful situations to closely mimic real-life violent encounters.  Makes sense, but no martial art does that, and that's what makes Krav Maga different. After several months as a student, I was asked to start training to become an instructor.  I reluctantly accepted, never thinking of myself as much of a teacher.  I had no idea how that one simple leap of faith would change my life forever.  In Aug of 2011, I earned my Black Belt in Krav Maga. Around the same time, I went through the Basic and Advanced Krav Maga Law Enforcement certification courses, which certified me to teach Krav Maga and defensive tactics to military and active law enforcement.  In March of 2013, I became the Chief Krav Maga Instructor for Self Defense Texas.  Krav Maga has made me a better and stronger person, both physically and mentally.  I love helping people learn new skills and gain confidence in their ability to actually defend themselves.  I am grateful for the dedicated students and instructors I get to work with on a daily basis.  They are the reason I continue to teach, and learn.

                <h5><br>I was raised learning traditional jui jitsu and later in boxing during my teens. I was a rough one getting into fights throughout my childhood. I joined the military straight out of high school and went into Special Operations. In that I was taught CQC (close quarter combat) and knife fighting. After my time in the military I trained in MMA for number of years before finally realizing I wanted to learn something without rules, something raw. My mother actually saw an ad for Krav Maga and asked if I'd go with her. So I went and was hooked right away. After 4 years and two different schools of training as a student I got my first certification as an instructor. This is now my purpose, my passion. I feel everyone deserves to know how to fight off attackers. So now I'm determined to teach law enforcement, government agencies, civilians, and most important women in the best ways to protect themselves.</h5>

                <h5><br>I've been a Krav Maga Instructor for about 5 years.  I'm also a former prosecutor and current criminal defense attorney.  Therefore, I like to say, I'm trained in self-defense and the law of self-defense, on which I periodically educate my students.  I started training in Krav Maga because I wanted to shed a few pounds.  My outlook was:  Losing weight will take energy.  If I'm going to expend energy, I might as well learn something while I do it (as opposed to running absent-mindedly on a treadmill).  That decision remains one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life.  Since training in Krav Maga, I feel fit and ready for any situation that may arise.  A couple years ago, I was in downtown Austin and I was trying to flag down a cab late at night.  When I finally did, a group of 4 guys came up to me and informed me that they were going to take the cab and began to close in on me.  It was clear they wanted to take more than the cab.  I quickly assessed the situation and the guys with whom I was dealing and I calmly informed them that this wouldn't end well...for them.  The guys walked off, after one of them said that it wasn't worth it.  I don't know what would've happened that night, but I know my training made me feel ready and unafraid.  My guess is, they sensed it and decided to go find a person more suitable to the role of victim.  I owe my response to that high-pressure situation all to my Krav Maga training.</h5>

                <h5><br>When I was six years old, I was sitting in my familyâ€™s living room, likely picking on my little brother, when my father saw an exclusive program on the television demonstrating Krav Maga techniques and advertising the product. It was that same day that he made the commitment to commute to California and bring the program by any means necessary to Texas, which is exactly what he did. While I donâ€™t remember many details about that day, Iâ€™ll never forget the passion he expressed for the art, which is the same passion that drives our business to this day. I am proud to say that I have had the opportunity to work with the company since its inception and be involved in all of its many programs and community outreach ventures. At the age of twelve, I earned my Krav Maga yellow belt and was an assistant instructor for our, then, kids program. As I got older and became involved in high school and collegiate sports, my primary interests shifted to the companyâ€™s fitness and nutrition programs, under which I trained with lead instructor Shari Hardy for several years, continuing to assist with the companyâ€™s general administrative duties. After graduating from Lamar University with a BBA, I chose to return to Krav Maga as part of the management staff and as a fitness instructor. I feel so blessed to work in an environment where everyone, staff and members included, are a family, and we are privileged to make a career of helping people to protect themselves, their families, and reach their health goals. </h5>

I noticed a Krav studio on my way to work one day and I was intrigued, so I did some research and knew I had to get in and start taking classes asap.  Of course that didn't happen.  Like most people, especially women, I was scared and intimidated so I kept making excuses to not get started.  Finally months later I pulled into the parking lot, told myself to quit being such a chicken sh**, and I took my first class.  I was hooked and the rest is history. I became a Krav Maga and Fitness instructor a year later  and now I get to help my students learn how to defend themselves and their families in this crazy world.  I am now a Level 3 Krav Maga Instructor, I teach Rape Prevention Seminars and Women's Only Self Defense Seminars.  Krav Maga has given me the confidence to know that I can defend myself and my daughters if I ever needed to, and that is a priceless gift.   As an instructor, sharing that gift with my students is amazing.  I get to help my students master their techniques, but even more importantly, I get to help them master their confidence and kick a$$ mentality.</h5>

                <h5><br>Krav Maga Experience: 13 years training/7 years teaching
My first encounter with Krav Maga was in 2001 when they first opened in the Austin area and began teaching at the gym I attended. Knowing nothing about Krav Maga, I approached an instructor to inquire about the program and was immediately invited (aka highly encouraged) into a class. My first thought was EEEEEK! My second thought was I LOVE HITTING PEOPLE! Krav Maga seemed so natural to me and was such a stress reliever that I JUST COULDN'T STOP! I started training at Elite Krav Maga under David and Sherry Smith and soon met Ryan and Shari Hardy, owners and operators of Self Defense Texas, where I continued to train. I have taught fitness for Round Rock Krav Maga and Self Defense Texas for 9 years and have been a self defense instructor for 7. In 2007, I completed my Phase A (yellow belt) instructor certification, and in 2009, I completed by Phase B (orange belt) instructor certification. Because of my love for Krav Maga, I will continue to train for my Phase C (green belt) certification. All I can say is WATCH OUT PEEPS, BECAUSE I LOVE HITTING PEOPLE!

                <h5><br>I've been a Krav Maga Instructor for 4 years. It hard to believe that time has gone by this fast.  I'm currently studying for me Level 2 instructor certification.  Prior to that I was a student who knew nothing about the self defense system but was intrigued. I tried out a class and the rest is history.  Krav Maga has changed my life both physically and mentally.  At the time I started as a student I was a bit overweight and out of shape.  I could not even walk up a few stairs without running out of breath.  It was terrible.  Krav Maga has helped me to achieve a sharper mental focus for those tasks that were difficult in the past.  I now apply the Krav Maga mentally of never giving up and giving 100 percent to all that I do.  It has also prepared me physically by allowing me to lose about 50 lbs due to the intense cardio workouts and skilled training twice a week. Krav Maga is fun and exciting and I try to have fun while doing it.</h5>

Besides getting into shape, Krav has given him a sense of awareness in his every day surroundings, self-control and discipline. He is a level 3 student and has been a level 1 instructor since 2013. He is in the process of pursuing his level 2 instructor certification and level 3 belt.</h5>

                <h5><br>I attended my first Krav Maga class about 8 years ago. After leaving I realized that I found what I have been looking for, for a long time. Krav Maga offers you the opportunity to excel physically while learning valuable tools to keep you safe and how to be aware and alert in vulnerable situations. It has helped me in my day to day life, as well as my career. Itâ€™s a great source of stress relief and if done correctly it never gets easy. Every class is a challenge and you are able to push yourself past your comfort level. Now as an instructor I also find it rewarding to pass along the fitness and self-defense lessons that have been taught to me.  I am excited to continue learning and advancing in levels. Black belt one day? Yes, I do believe so.</h5>

                <h5><br>I first joined Krav in 2003 after a few of my coworkers joined and began coming to work bragging about improved cardio endurance, muscle tone, and chronically throwing up while in class.  I was intrigued and had to find out what all the fuss was about.  Shortly after joining I cancelled all of my other memberships; Gold's Gym, Clay Madson, Tan It All, AA, everything!!! I found something that I truly loved and a place where I felt like I belonged.  Over the years I've made lifelong friendships that mean the world to me.  I've also met a group of like-minded friends that always encourage me to do better, to be better, or to go home.  Obviously, I don't choose the latter because I'm pretty sure their lives would be incomplete without my friendship.  On a less jovial noteâ€¦I'm happy at Krav.  I always leave feeling better.  Whether it's through what they teach me or meeting personal goals, it's been one of the highlights of my life.</h5>

                <h5><br>Hi! My name is Kerri, aka "Killer Kerri". I teach BodyWorks and Cardio Kickbox Bag classes. My instructing style has been described as "super motivational". I have been a member of Krav Maga since 2002 and an instructor since 2004. I am a certified personal trainer and am, also, certified in kickbox, group exercise, and spin. I was 30+ pounds overweight when I joined Krav. Not only did I lose weight through the fitness classes, I also gained confidence, becoming stronger physically, mentally and emotionally. I found the confidence to believe that I could reach any goal that I set for myself. For instance, I started running and have now completed 13 marathons and lead a running group during warmer months for our club members. I enjoy helping people reach their fitness goals, and Krav allows me to do that.  Come try a class and see the difference for yourself!</h5>
